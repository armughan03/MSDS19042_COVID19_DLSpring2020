## COVID-19 Classification
In this, I have tried to experiment on few thousand X-Rays of Normal and COVID-19 patients. RESNET18, VGG16 are the two pretrained models that I have chosen for this and done two different experiments.
First was to simply fine tune the output layer according to the dataset while keeping the all other layers in  both models freezing and other was to unfreeze few CNN layers and then all the network.
